# Animation
Repository of Manim code to create animations for science presentations.
This will be upgraded as I code material.


TO DO:

- Create small subfiles and add them to init
- Create test animations (2) with functions that return a play and call them somewhere else.
- Add documentation to start creating package.
- Check 3b1brown organisation. Check if it can be improved.
